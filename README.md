Instagram account - https://www.instagram.com/nasa_picture_of_the_day

## ENV Setup

> INSTA_USER

The user name of the instagram account.

> INSTA_PASS

The password of the instagram account.

> API_KEY

The Api key from NASA. - https://api.nasa.gov

> GOOGLE_PASS

The password of your gmail account.<br>
NOTE: This is required because sometimes instagram sends verification code to verify the login attempt. The bot will get the code from gmail using this password. I have added a browser automation script with puppeteer to get the code.
